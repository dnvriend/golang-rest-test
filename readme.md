# golang-rest-test
A small study project on [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) with
the [gorilla/mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) router.

## How to install
With a correctly configured Go toolchain, navigate to your $GOPATH root folder, most often `~/go`, and type:

```
go get -u github.com/dnvriend/golang-rest-test/...
```

This should create a binary in `$GOPATH/bin`

## How to run
Navigate to `~/go/src/github.com/dnvriend/golang-test` directory and type `make run`

## How to build
To manually build a binary, navigate to `~/go/src/github.com/dnvriend/golang-test` directory
nd type `make install`, this should create a binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.

Have fun!
