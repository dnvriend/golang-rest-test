# golang-rest-test
A small study project on Golang with the gorilla/mux router

## How to install
With a correctly configured Go toolchain, navigate to your $GOPATH root folder, most often `~/go`, and type:

```
go get -u github.com/dnvriend/golang-rest-test
```

## How to run
Navigate to `~/go/src/github.com/dnvriend/golang-test` directory and type `make run`

## How to build
Navigate to `~/go/src/github.com/dnvriend/golang-test` directory and type `make install`, this should create a binary
in `$GOPATH/bin`.

Have fun!
